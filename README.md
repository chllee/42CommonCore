# 42CommonCore
This repository is a consolidation of the projects completed during the course of the Common Core program in 42 Singapore x SUTD. 

There are a total of 7 milestones to complete the common core program, before moving on to further the Advanced Core where we then get to choose areas of programming that we would like to specialize in.

# Milestone 0
### **Projects** - Libft

### Libft + Bonus (Linked Lists)
The Libft project is the first project of 42 Schools' Common Core program. After surviving a gruelling 26-day Piscine, we start our journey in quintessential 42 style - Recreating essential library functions that we will use in our future projects. 

The Libft milestone is a crucially important step in setting a solid foundation for later milestones. Totaling 43 functions, Libft requires us to replicate 26 functions in accordance with the given man pages, with an additional 17 functions covering other commonly used functions in high level programming languages that may or may not have a standard man page.

**BONUS : Attempted & Cleared** <br />
The bonus section introduces students to the concept of Structures and Linked Lists.
